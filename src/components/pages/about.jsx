                Hello, it's nice to see that you're hereðŸ‘‹. Here's a little
                knowledge about me.
              </p>
              <p className="first-letter:text-2xl md:first-letter:text-5xl first-letter:text-accentColor first-letter:font-semibold indent-3 mb-2">
                I wrote my first line of code in 2021, It was in HTML and ever
                since then, I have always wanted to learn more to see what I can
                build and how I can be of importance in creating websites which
                offer information, entertainment, education and so on to the
                public.
              </p>
              <p className="first-letter:text-2xl md:first-letter:text-5xl first-letter:text-accentColor first-letter:font-semibold indent-3 mb-2">
                As a side note, I have a little bit of interest in game
                development and hope to venture into it some time in the future.
                I also have an interest in photography, nature photography to be
                precise. I read webtoons in my spare time and I listen to music
                with every chance I get.

                I hope that was enough for a basic introduction. Let's work
                together to fulfill both your dreams and mine, shall we?
